## My Projects
### Created public key infrastruction based on RSA 
Implemented RSA Encryption/Decryption amd Digital Signature using python. 2024
‚Ä¢ Implemented RSA encryption/decryption for secure communication using 16-bit random prime numbers. Integrated
digital signatures with private keys to authenticate entitie

### Ghindra Reverse engineering tool plugin
- **Description**: Developed a Jython script plugin for Ghidra targeting known DLL injection techniques. Demonstrated DLL injection in game, showcasing the vulnerabilities. Integrated script into Ghidra to automatically identify instances of these functions in binaries, alerting users to possible DLL injection attacks.
- **Technologies Used**: Reverse engineering tool Gidra,Python, Java, Wesnoth Game, DLL.

### Cloud Platform and Network Security 
‚Ä¢ Installed OpenStack to deploy a multi-node virtual network and security assessments.
‚Ä¢ Deployed a cloud environment secured with Snort, an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), to mitigate
TCP SYN flood attacks. Integrated custom Snort rules and security groups against real-world cyber threats.

### IoT Device Scanner and Packet Capture Tool
‚Ä¢ Developed IoT device scanner using Python, enabled to discover, analyze active devices on local Wi-Fi networks.
‚Ä¢ Stored captured data in pcap format and organized it in a SQLite database for analysis.
‚Ä¢ Integrated API calls for real-time vendor identification based on MAC addresses, enhancing user experience by
providing detailed device information alongside packet analysis capabilities.

### Kernel Fuzzer Security Evaluation 2024
‚Ä¢ Analyzed automated deduplication tools such as Syzkaller, Syzbot uncovering limitations to enhance bug
detection, aiming to optimize efficiency in Kernel Fuzzer.
  
## Experience
- Challenge designer AtHackCTF, Concordia University's first national Capture The Flag competition brought to you by TECHNATION and Hexploit-Alliance. [more](https://github.com/highfunctioning/crackme)
  
Cyber Security Intern
Police Cyber Security Summer Internship Gurugram, India
‚Ä¢ Reviewed 20+ live cybercrime case studies, social engineering attacks, phishing, ransomware, and data breaches.
‚Ä¢ Collaborated with law enforcement officers to analyze, interpret digital evidence, improving outcomes by 15 percent.
‚Ä¢ Assisted in developing enhanced cybercrime response protocols based on case study findings.
